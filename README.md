# BitSort

## Description
Uses bitwise operators to sort an array of integers. Negative values "technically" work, but a more elegant solution to them is in the works. The sort should work in O(n*log(k)) time, where k = the maximum value in the array.

## How to use
"size" is default to 100,000; 
lower and upper bound defaults to 10 and 1000 (respectively); 
Any of these variables can be easily changed.
